Question 2
Create a program that analyses temperature data collected from multiple weather
stations in Australia. The data is stored in multiple CSV files under a temperatures
folder, with each file representing data from one year.

You need to:

1.Calculate the average temperatures for each season across all years. Save the
result to file “average_temp.txt”.
2. Find the station/stations have the largest temperature range. Save the result to
file “largest_temp_range_station.txt”.
3. Find the warmest and coolest station/stations. Save the result to file
“warmest_and_coolest_station.txt”.
4. Find the year with the highest average temperature and save the result to file
