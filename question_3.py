"""
Recursive function to draw a tree like pattern
Basically recursive function is a method used to solve certain problems by creating a function 
that calls itself until the program achieve the desired result.

What we are doing right here is we have defined a function and few parameters has been defined to let user 
type it according to how they would like to call it.

After setting everything up we are calling the draw_tree_pattern() function inside itself
reducing depth by 1 and branch_lenth by 70% each time.

left_angle = this rotate to the left by the angle user has input.
right_angle = this rotate to the right by the angle user has input.
Depth = This tells how many “layers” of branches the tree should have. The deeper the tree, the more branches it will have.
reduction_factor = This will reduce the new branch by 70% compared to previous branch.
branch_length = This will be the length of the current branch input by user and it will be less each time calling it recursively.

Each time darwing left and right we return to the orginal postion  to draw the other side of the branches.

when reaching the condition depth = 0 then it will stop drawing becuase we have reached the smallest barnch.
and it stop calling itself and then the drawing ends.
